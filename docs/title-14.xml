If more than 60 passenger seats are installed, then:</P><P>(1) If the extra seats are not suitable for occupancy during taxi, takeoff and landing, each extra seat must be clearly marked (e.g., a placard on the top of an armrest, or a placard sewn into the top of the back cushion) that the seat is not to be occupied during taxi, takeoff and landing.</P><P>(2) If the extra seats are suitable for occupancy during taxi, takeoff and landing (<I>i.e.,</I> meet all the strength and passenger injury criteria in part 25), then a note must be included in the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual that there are extra seats installed but that the number of passengers on the airplane must not exceed 60. Additionally, there must be a placard installed adjacent to each door that can be used as a passenger boarding door that states that the maximum passenger capacity is 60. The placard must be clearly legible to passengers entering the airplane.</P><P>(b) For airplanes outfitted with interior doors under paragraph 10 of this SFAR, the airplane flight manual (AFM) must include an appropriate limitation that the airplane must be staffed with at least the following number of flight attendants who meet the requirements of 14 CFR 91.533(b):</P><P>(1) The number of flight attendants required by &#xA7; 91.533(a)(1) and (2) of this chapter, and</P><P>(2) At least one flight attendant if the airplane model was originally certified for 75 passengers or more.</P><P>(c) The AFM must include appropriate limitation(s) to require a preflight passenger briefing describing the appropriate functions to be performed by the passengers and the relevant features of the airplane to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew.</P><P>(d) The airplane may not be offered for common carriage or operated for hire. The operating limitations section of the AFM must be revised to prohibit any operations involving the carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire. The operators may receive remuneration to the extent consistent with parts 125 and 91, subpart F, of this chapter.</P><P>(e) A placard stating that &#x201C;Operations involving the carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire are prohibited,&#x201D; must be located in the area of the Airworthiness Certificate holder at the entrance to the flightdeck.</P><P>(f) For passenger capacities of 45 to 60 passengers, analysis must be submitted that demonstrates that the airplane can be evacuated in less than 90 seconds under the conditions specified in &#xA7; 25.803 and appendix J to part 25.</P><P>(g) In order for any airplane certified under this SFAR to be placed in part 135 or part 121 operations, the airplane must be brought back into full compliance with the applicable operational part.</P><HD2>Equipment and Design </HD2><P>3. <I>General.</I> Unless otherwise noted, compliance is required with the applicable certification basis for the airplane. Some provisions of this SFAR impose alternative requirements to certain airworthiness standards that do not apply to airplanes certificated to earlier standards. Those airplanes with an earlier certification basis are not required to comply with those alternative requirements.</P><P>4. <I>Occupant Protection.</I></P><P>(a) Firm Handhold. In lieu of the requirements of &#xA7; 25.785(j), there must be means provided to enable persons to steady themselves in moderately rough air while occupying aisles that are along the cabin sidewall, or where practicable, bordered by seats (seat backs providing a 25-pound minimum breakaway force are an acceptable means of compliance).</P><P>(b) Injury criteria for multiple occupancy side-facing seats. The following requirements are only applicable to airplanes that are subject to &#xA7; 25.562.</P><P>(1) <I>Existing Criteria.</I> All injury protection criteria of &#xA7; 25.562(c)(1) through (c)(6) apply to the occupants of side-facing seating. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) assessments are only required for head contact with the seat and/or adjacent structures.</P><P>(2) <I>Body-to-Body Contact.</I> Contact between the head, pelvis, torso or shoulder area of one Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) with the head, pelvis, torso or shoulder area of the ATD in the adjacent seat is not allowed during the tests conducted in accordance with &#xA7; 25.562(b)(1) and (b)(2). Contact during rebound is allowed.</P><P>(3) <I>Thoracic Trauma.</I> If the torso of an ATD at the forward-most seat place impacts the seat and/or adjacent structure during testing, compliance with the Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI) injury criterion must be substantiated by dynamic test or by rational analysis based on previous test(s) of a similar seat installation. TTI data must be acquired with a Side Impact Dummy (SID), as defined by 49 CFR part 572, subpart F, or an equivalent ATD or a more appropriate ATD and must be processed as defined in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) part 571.214, section S6.13.5 (49 CFR 571.214). The TTI must be less than 85, as defined in 49 CFR part 572, subpart F. Torso contact during rebound is acceptable and need not be measured.</P><P>(4) <I>Pelvis.</I> If the pelvis of an ATD at any seat place impacts seat and/or adjacent structure during testing, pelvic lateral acceleration injury criteria must be substantiated by dynamic test or by rational analysis based on previous test(s) of a similar seat installation. Pelvic lateral acceleration may not exceed 130g. Pelvic acceleration data must be processed as defined in FMVSS part 571.214, section S6.13.5 (49 CFR 571.214).</P><P>(5) <I>Body-to-Wall/Furnishing Contact.</I> If the seat is installed aft of a structure&#x2014;such as an interior wall or furnishing that may contact the pelvis, upper arm, chest, or head of an occupant seated next to the structure&#x2014;the structure or a conservative representation of the structure and its stiffness must be included in the tests. It is recommended, but not required, that the contact surface of the actual structure be covered with at least two inches of energy absorbing protective padding (foam or equivalent) such as Ensolite.</P><P>(6) <I>Shoulder Strap Loads.</I> Where upper torso straps (shoulder straps) are used for sofa occupants, the tension loads in individual straps may not exceed 1,750 pounds. If dual straps are used for restraining the upper torso, the total strap tension loads may not exceed 2,000 pounds.</P><P>(7) <I>Occupant Retention.</I> All side-facing seats require end closures or other means to prevent the ATD's pelvis from translating beyond the end of the seat at any time during testing.</P><P>(8) <I>Test Parameters.</I></P><P>(i) All seat positions need to be occupied by ATDs for the longitudinal tests.</P><P>(ii) A minimum of one longitudinal test, conducted in accordance with the conditions specified in &#xA7; 25.562(b)(2), is required to assess the injury criteria as follows. Note that if a seat is installed aft of structure (such as an interior wall or furnishing) that does not have a homogeneous surface, an additional test or tests may be required to demonstrate that the injury criteria are met for the area which an occupant could contact. For example, different yaw angles could result in different injury considerations and may require separate tests to evaluate.</P><P>(A) For configurations without structure (such as a wall or bulkhead) installed directly forward of the forward seat place, Hybrid II ATDs or equivalent must be in all seat places.</P><P>(B) For configurations with structure (such as a wall or bulkhead) installed directly forward of the forward seat place, a side impact dummy or equivalent ATD or more appropriate ATD must be in the forward seat place and a Hybrid II ATD or equivalent must be in all other seat places.</P><P>(C) The test may be conducted with or without deformed floor.</P><P>(D) The test must be conducted with either no yaw or 10 degrees yaw for evaluating occupant injury. Deviating from the no yaw condition may not result in the critical area of contact not being evaluated. The upper torso restraint straps, where installed, must remain on the occupant's shoulder during the impact condition of &#xA7; 25.562(b)(2).</P><P>(c) For the vertical test, conducted in accordance with the conditions specified in &#xA7; 25.562(b)(1), Hybrid II ATDs or equivalent must be used in all seat positions.</P><P>5. <I>Direct View.</I> In lieu of the requirements of &#xA7; 25.785(h)(2), to the extent practical without compromising proximity to a required floor level emergency exit, the majority of installed flight attendant seats must be located to face the cabin area for which the flight attendant is responsible.</P><P>6. <I>Passenger Information Signs.</I> Compliance with &#xA7; 25.791 is required except that for &#xA7; 25.791(a), when smoking is to be prohibited, notification to the passengers may be provided by a single placard so stating, to be conspicuously located inside the passenger compartment, easily visible to all persons entering the cabin in the immediate vicinity of each passenger entry door.</P><P>7. <I>Distance Between Exits.</I> For an airplane that is required to comply with &#xA7; 25.807(f)(4), in effect as of July 24, 1989, which has more than one passenger emergency exit on each side of the fuselage, no passenger emergency exit may be more than 60 feet from any adjacent passenger emergency exit on the same side of the same deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges, unless the following conditions are met:</P><P>(a) Each passenger seat must be located within 30 feet from the nearest exit on each side of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis, between the nearest exit edge and the front of the seat bottom cushion.</P><P>(b) The number of passenger seats located between two adjacent pairs of emergency exits (commonly referred to as a passenger zone) or between a pair of exits and a bulkhead or a compartment door (commonly referred to as a &#x201C;dead-end zone&#x201D;), may not exceed the following:</P><P>(1) For zones between two pairs of exits, 50 percent of the combined rated capacity of the two pairs of emergency exits.</P><P>(2) For zones between one pair of exits and a bulkhead, 40 percent of the rated capacity of the pair of emergency exits.</P><P>(c) The total number of passenger seats in the airplane may not exceed 33 percent of the maximum seating capacity for the airplane model using the exit ratings listed in &#xA7; 25.807(g) for the original certified exits or the maximum allowable after modification when exits are deactivated, whichever is less.</P><P>(d) A distance of more than 60 feet between adjacent passenger emergency exits on the same side of the same deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges, is allowed only once on each side of the fuselage.</P><P>8. <I>Emergency Exit Signs.</I> In lieu of the requirements of &#xA7; 25.811(d)(1) and (2) a single sign at each exit may be installed provided:</P><P>(a) The sign can be read from the aisle while directly facing the exit, and</P><P>(b) The sign can be read from the aisle adjacent to the passenger seat that is farthest from the exit and that does not have an intervening bulkhead/divider or exit.</P><P>9. <I>Emergency Lighting.</I></P><P>(a) <I>Exit Signs.</I> In lieu of the requirements of &#xA7; 25.812(b)(1), for airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 19 seats or less, the emergency exit signs required by &#xA7; 25.811(d)(1), (2), and (3) must have red letters at least 1-inch high on a white background at least 2 inches high. These signs may be internally electrically illuminated, or self illuminated by other than electrical means, with an initial brightness of at least 160 microlamberts. The color may be reversed in the case of a sign that is self-illuminated by other than electrical means.</P><P>(b) <I>Floor Proximity Escape Path Marking.</I> In lieu of the requirements of &#xA7; 25.812(e)(1), for cabin seating compartments that do not have the main cabin aisle entering and exiting the compartment, the following are applicable:</P><P>(1) After a passenger leaves any passenger seat in the compartment, he/she must be able to exit the compartment to the main cabin aisle using only markings and visual features not more that 4 feet above the cabin floor, and</P><P>(2) Proceed to the exits using the marking system necessary to accomplish the actions in &#xA7; 25.812(e)(1) and (e)(2).</P><P>(c) <I>Transverse Separation of the Fuselage.</I> In the event of a transverse separation of the fuselage, compliance must be shown with &#xA7; 25.812(l) except as follows:</P><P>(1) For each airplane type originally type certificated with a maximum passenger seating capacity of 9 or less, not more than 50 percent of all electrically illuminated emergency lights required by &#xA7; 25.812 may be rendered inoperative in addition to the lights that are directly damaged by the separation.</P><P>(2) For each airplane type originally type certificated with a maximum passenger seating capacity of 10 to 19, not more than 33 percent of all electrically illuminated emergency lights required by &#xA7; 25.812 may be rendered inoperative in addition to the lights that are directly damaged by the separation.</P><P>10. <I>Interior doors.</I> In lieu of the requirements of &#xA7; 25.813(e), interior doors may be installed between passenger seats and exits, provided the following requirements are met.</P><P>(a) Each door between any passenger seat, occupiable for taxi, takeoff, and landing, and any emergency exit must have a means to signal to the flightcrew, at the flightdeck, that the door is in the open position for taxi, takeoff and landing.</P><P>(b) Appropriate procedures/limitations must be established to ensure that any such door is in the open configuration for takeoff and landing.</P><P>(c) Each door between any passenger seat and any exit must have dual means to retain it in the open position, each of which is capable of reacting the inertia loads specified in &#xA7; 25.561.</P><P>(d) Doors installed across a longitudinal aisle must translate laterally to open and close, e.g., pocket doors.</P><P>(e) Each door between any passenger seat and any exit must be frangible in either direction.</P><P>(f) Each door between any passenger seat and any exit must be operable from either side, and if a locking mechanism is installed, it must be capable of being unlocked from either side without the use of special tools.</P><P>11. <I>Width of Aisle.</I> Compliance is required with &#xA7; 25.815, except that aisle width may be reduced to 0 inches between passenger seats during in-flight operations only, provided that the applicant demonstrates that all areas of the cabin are easily accessible by a crew member in the event of an emergency (e.g., in-flight fire, decompression). Additionally, instructions must be provided at each passenger seat for restoring the aisle width required by &#xA7; 25.815. Procedures must be established and documented in the AFM to ensure that the required aisle widths are provided during taxi, takeoff, and landing.</P><P>12. <I>Materials for Compartment Interiors.</I> Compliance is required with the applicable provisions of &#xA7; 25.853, except that compliance with appendix F, parts IV and V, to part 25, need not be demonstrated if it can be shown by test or a combination of test and analysis that the maximum time for evacuation of all occupants does not exceed 45 seconds under the conditions specified in appendix J to part 25.</P><P>13. <I>Fire Detection.</I> For airplanes with a type certificated passenger capacity of 20 or more, there must be means that meet the requirements of &#xA7; 25.858(a) through (d) to signal the flightcrew in the event of a fire in any isolated room not occupiable for taxi, takeoff and landing, which can be closed off from the rest of the cabin by a door. The indication must identify the compartment where the fire is located. This does not apply to lavatories, which continue to be governed by &#xA7; 25.854.</P><P>14. <I>Cooktops.</I> Each cooktop must be designed and installed to minimize any potential threat to the airplane, passengers, and crew. Compliance with this requirement must be found in accordance with the following criteria:</P><P>(a) Means, such as conspicuous burner-on indicators, physical barriers, or handholds, must be installed to minimize the potential for inadvertent personnel contact with hot surfaces of both the cooktop and cookware. Conditions of turbulence must be considered.</P><P>(b) Sufficient design means must be included to restrain cookware while in place on the cooktop, as well as representative contents, e.g., soup, sauces, etc., from the effects of flight loads and turbulence. Restraints must be provided to preclude hazardous movement of cookware and contents. These restraints must accommodate any cookware that is identified for use with the cooktop. Restraints must be designed to be easily utilized and effective in service. The cookware restraint system should also be designed so that it will not be easily disabled, thus rendering it unusable. Placarding must be installed which prohibits the use of cookware that cannot be accommodated by the restraint system.</P><P>(c) Placarding must be installed which prohibits the use of cooktops (i.e., power on any burner) during taxi, takeoff, and landing.</P><P>(d) Means must be provided to address the possibility of a fire occurring on or in the immediate vicinity of the cooktop. Two acceptable means of complying with this requirement are as follows:</P><P>(1) Placarding must be installed that prohibits any burner from being powered when the cooktop is unattended. (<E T="04">Note</E>: This would prohibit a single person from cooking on the cooktop and intermittently serving food to passengers while any burner is powered.) A fire detector must be installed in the vicinity of the cooktop which provides an audible warning in the passenger cabin, and a fire extinguisher of appropriate size and extinguishing agent must be installed in the immediate vicinity of the cooktop. Access to the extinguisher may not be blocked by a fire on or around the cooktop.</P><P>(2) An automatic, thermally activated fire suppression system must be installed to extinguish a fire at the cooktop and immediately adjacent surfaces. The agent used in the system must be an approved total flooding agent suitable for use in an occupied area. The fire suppression system must have a manual override. The automatic activation of the fire suppression system must also automatically shut off power to the cooktop.</P><P>(e) The surfaces of the galley surrounding the cooktop which would be exposed to a fire on the cooktop surface or in cookware on the cooktop must be constructed of materials that comply with the flammability requirements of part III of appendix F to part 25. This requirement is in addition to the flammability requirements typically required of the materials in these galley surfaces. During the selection of these materials, consideration must also be given to ensure that the flammability characteristics of the materials will not be adversely affected by the use of cleaning agents and utensils used to remove cooking stains.</P><P>(f) The cooktop must be ventilated with a system independent of the airplane cabin and cargo ventilation system. Procedures and time intervals must be established to inspect and clean or replace the ventilation system to prevent a fire hazard from the accumulation of flammable oils and be included in the instructions for continued airworthiness. The ventilation system ducting must be protected by a flame arrestor. [<E T="04">Note</E>: The applicant may find additional useful information in Society of Automotive Engineers, Aerospace Recommended Practice 85, Rev. E, entitled &#x201C;Air Conditioning Systems for Subsonic Airplanes,&#x201D; dated August 1, 1991.]</P><P>(g) Means must be provided to contain spilled foods or fluids in a manner that will prevent the creation of a slipping hazard to occupants and will not lead to the loss of structural strength due to airplane corrosion.</P><P>(h) Cooktop installations must provide adequate space for the user to immediately escape a hazardous cooktop condition.</P><P>(i) A means to shut off power to the cooktop must be provided at the galley containing the cooktop and in the cockpit. If additional switches are introduced in the cockpit, revisions to smoke or fire emergency procedures of the AFM will be required.</P><P>(j) If the cooktop is required to have a lid to enclose the cooktop there must be a means to automatically shut off power to the cooktop when the lid is closed.</P><P>15. <I>Hand-Held Fire Extinguishers.</I></P><P>(a) For airplanes that were originally type certificated with more than 60 passengers, the number of hand-held fire extinguishers must be the greater of&#x2014;</P><P>(1) That provided in accordance with the requirements of &#xA7; 25.851, or</P><P>(2) A number equal to the number of originally type certificated exit pairs, regardless of whether the exits are deactivated for the proposed configuration.</P><P>(b) Extinguishers must be evenly distributed throughout the cabin. These extinguishers are in addition to those required by paragraph 14 of this SFAR, unless it can be shown that the cooktop was installed in the immediate vicinity of the original exits.</P><P>16. <I>Security.</I> The requirements of &#xA7; 25.795 are not applicable to airplanes approved in accordance with this SFAR.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[Doc.

This evaluation must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, for each part of the structure that could contribute to a catastrophic failure (such as wing, empennage, control surfaces and their systems, the fuselage, engine mounting, landing gear, and their related primary attachments).

The limit of validity of the engineering data that supports the structural maintenance program (hereafter referred to as LOV), stated as a number of total accumulated flight cycles or flight hours or both, established by this section must also be included in the Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by &#xA7; 25.1529.

Repeated load and static analyses supported by test evidence and (if available) service experience must also be incorporated in the evaluation. Special consideration for widespread fatigue damage must be included where the design is such that this type of damage could occur. An LOV must be established that corresponds to the period of time, stated as a number of total accumulated flight cycles or flight hours or both, during which it is demonstrated that widespread fatigue damage will not occur in the airplane structure. This demonstration must be by full-scale fatigue test evidence. The type certificate may be issued prior to completion of full-scale fatigue testing, provided the Administrator has approved a plan for completing the required tests. In that case, the Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by &#xA7; 25.1529 must specify that no airplane may be operated beyond a number of cycles equal to <FR>1/2</FR> the number of cycles accumulated on the fatigue test article, until such testing is completed.

Opening by persons, either inadvertently or intentionally, need not be considered in making this determination.</P><P>(2) The door would remain inside the airplane or remain attached to the airplane if it opens either in pressurized or unpressurized portions of the flight. This determination must include the consideration of inadvertent and intentional opening by persons during either pressurized or unpressurized portions of the flight.</P><P>(3) The disengagement of the latches during flight would not allow depressurization of the cabin to an unsafe level. This safety assessment must include the physiological effects on the occupants.</P><P>(4) The open door during flight would not create aerodynamic interference that could preclude safe flight and landing.</P><P>(5) The airplane would meet the structural design requirements with the door open. This assessment must include the aeroelastic stability requirements of &#xA7; 25.629, as well as the strength requirements of subpart C of this part.</P><P>(6) The unlatching or opening of the door must not preclude safe flight and landing as a result of interaction with other systems or structures.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[Doc.

If a different material combination is used for the back cushion than for the bottom cushion, both material combinations must be tested as complete specimen sets, each set consisting of a back cushion specimen and a bottom cushion specimen. If a cushion, including outer dress covering, is demonstrated to meet the requirements of this appendix using the oil burner test, the dress covering of that cushion may be replaced with a similar dress covering provided the burn length of the replacement covering, as determined by the test specified in &#xA7; 25.853(c), does not exceed the corresponding burn length of the dress covering used on the cushion subjected to the oil burner test.</P><P>(4) For at least two-thirds of the total number of specimen sets tested, the burn length from the burner must not reach the side of the cushion opposite the burner. The burn length must not exceed 17 inches. Burn length is the perpendicular distance from the inside edge of the seat frame closest to the burner to the farthest evidence of damage to the test specimen due to flame impingement, including areas of partial or complete consumption, charring, or embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, warped, or discolored, or areas where material has shrunk or melted away from the heat source.</P><P>(5) The average percentage weight loss must not exceed 10 percent.

The specimen's exposure is determined by a radiant heat source adjusted to produce, on the specimen, the desired total heat flux of 3.5 W/cm <SU>2</SU>. The specimen is tested with the exposed surface vertical. Combustion is initiated by piloted ignition. The combustion products leaving the chamber are monitored in order to calculate the release rate of heat.</P><P>(b) <I>Apparatus.</I> The Ohio State University (OSU) rate of heat release apparatus, as described below, is used. This is a modified version of the rate of heat release apparatus standardized by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), ASTM E-906.</P><P>(1) This apparatus is shown in Figures 1A and 1B of this part IV. All exterior surfaces of the apparatus, except the holding chamber, must be insulated with 1 inch (25 mm) thick, low density, high temperature, fiberglass board insulation.

The air-supply manifold at the base of the pyramidal section must have 48, evenly spaced, No. 26 drill holes located .38 inch (10 mm) from the inner edge of the manifold, resulting in an airflow split of approximately three to one within the apparatus.</P><P>(5) <I>Exhaust Stack.</I> An exhaust stack, 5.25 &#xD7; 2.75 inches (133 &#xD7; 70 mm) in cross section, and 10 inches (254 mm) long, fabricated from 28 guage stainless steel must be mounted on the outlet of the pyramidal section. A. 1.0 &#xD7; 3.0 inch (25 &#xD7; 76 mm) baffle plate of .018 &#xB1;.002 inch (.50 &#xB1;.05 mm) stainless steel must be centered inside the stack, perpendicular to the air flow, 3 inches (76 mm) above the base of the stack.</P><P>(6) <I>Specimen Holders.</I> (i) The specimen must be tested in a vertical orientation. The specimen holder (Figure 3 of this part IV) must incorporate a frame that touches the specimen (which is wrapped with aluminum foil as required by paragraph (d)(3) of this Part) along only the .25 inch (6 mm) perimeter. A &#x201C;V&#x201D; shaped spring is used to hold the assembly together. A detachable .50 &#xD7; 50 &#xD7; 5.91 inch (12 &#xD7; 12 &#xD7; 150 mm) drip pan and two .020 inch (.5 mm) stainless steel wires (as shown in Figure 3 of this part IV) must be used for testing materials prone to melting and dripping. The positioning of the spring and frame may be changed to accommodate different specimen thicknesses by inserting the retaining rod in different holes on the specimen holder.</P><P>(ii) Since the radiation shield described in ASTM E-906 is not used, a guide pin must be added to the injection mechanism. This fits into a slotted metal plate on the injection mechanism outside of the holding chamber. It can be used to provide accurate positioning of the specimen face after injection. The front surface of the specimen must be 3.9 inches (100 mm) from the closed radiation doors after injection.</P><P>(iii) The specimen holder clips onto the mounted bracket (Figure 3 of this part IV). The mounting bracket must be attached to the injection rod by three screws that pass through a wide-area washer welded onto a <FR>1/2</FR>-inch (13 mm) nut. The end of the injection rod must be threaded to screw into the nut, and a .020 inch (5.1 mm) thick wide area washer must be held between two <FR>1/2</FR>-inch (13 mm) nuts that are adjusted to tightly cover the hole in the radiation doors through which the injection rod or calibration calorimeter pass.</P><P>(7) <I>Calorimeter.</I> A total-flux type calorimeter must be mounted in the center of a <FR>1/2</FR>-inch Kaowool &#x201C;M&#x201D; board inserted in the sample holder to measure the total heat flux. The calorimeter must have a view angle of 180 degrees and be calibrated for incident flux. The calorimeter calibration must be acceptable to the Administrator.</P><P>(8) <I>Pilot-Flame Positions.</I> Pilot ignition of the specimen must be accomplished by simultaneously exposing the specimen to a lower pilot burner and an upper pilot burner, as described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) and (b)(8)(ii) or (b)(8)(iii) of this part IV, respectively. Since intermittent pilot flame extinguishment for more than 3 seconds would invalidate the test results, a spark ignitor may be installed to ensure that the lower pilot burner remains lighted.</P><P>(i) <I>Lower Pilot Burner.</I> The pilot-flame tubing must be .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8mm) wall, stainless steel tubing. A mixture of 120 cm <SU>3</SU>/min. of methane and 850 cm <SU>3</SU>/min. of air must be fed to the lower pilot flame burner. The normal position of the end of the pilot burner tubing is .40 inch (10 mm) from and perpendicular to the exposed vertical surface of the specimen. The centerline at the outlet of the burner tubing must intersect the vertical centerline of the sample at a point .20 inch (5 mm) above the lower exposed edge of the specimen.</P><P>(ii) <I>Standard Three-Hole Upper Pilot Burner.</I> The pilot burner must be a straight length of .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, stainless steel tubing that is 14 inches (360 mm) long. One end of the tubing must be closed, and three No. 40 drill holes must be drilled into the tubing, 2.38 inch (60 mm) apart, for gas ports, all radiating in the same direction. The first hole must be .19 inch (5 mm) from the closed end of the tubing. The tube must be positioned .75 inch (19 mm) above and .75 inch (19 mm) behind the exposed upper edge of the specimen. The middle hole must be in the vertical plane perpendicular to the exposed surface of the specimen which passes through its vertical centerline and must be pointed toward the radiation source. The gas supplied to the burner must be methane and must be adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm).</P><P>(iii) <I>Optional Fourteen-Hole Upper Pilot Burner.</I> This burner may be used in lieu of the standard three-hole burner described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this part IV. The pilot burner must be a straight length of .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, stainless steel tubing that is 15.75 inches (400 mm) long. One end of the tubing must be closed, and 14 No. 59 drill holes must be drilled into the tubing, .50 inch (13 mm) apart, for gas ports, all radiating in the same direction. The first hole must be .50 inch (13 mm) from the closed end of the tubing. The tube must be positioned above the specimen holder so that the holes are placed above the specimen as shown in Figure 1B of this part IV. The fuel supplied to the burner must be methane mixed with air in a ratio of approximately 50/50 by volume. The total gas flow must be adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm). When the gas/air ratio and the flow rate are properly adjusted, approximately .25 inch (6 mm) of the flame length appears yellow in color.</P><P>(c) <I>Calibration of Equipment</I>&#x2014;(1) <I>Heat Release Rate.</I> A calibration burner, as shown in Figure 4, must be placed over the end of the lower pilot flame tubing using a gas tight connection. The flow of gas to the pilot flame must be at least 99 percent methane and must be accurately metered. Prior to usage, the wet test meter must be properly leveled and filled with distilled water to the tip of the internal pointer while no gas is flowing. Ambient temperature and pressure of the water are based on the internal wet test meter temperature. A baseline flow rate of approximately 1 liter/min. must be set and increased to higher preset flows of 4, 6, 8, 6 and 4 liters/min. Immediately prior to recording methane flow rates, a flow rate of 8 liters/min. must be used for 2 minutes to precondition the chamber. This is not recorded as part of calibration. The rate must be determined by using a stopwatch to time a complete revolution of the wet test meter for both the baseline and higher flow, with the flow returned to baseline before changing to the next higher flow. The thermopile baseline voltage must be measured. The gas flow to the burner must be increased to the higher preset flow and allowed to burn for 2.0 minutes, and the thermopile voltage must be measured. The sequence must be repeated until all five values have been determined. The average of the five values must be used as the calibration factor. The procedure must be repeated if the percent relative standard deviation is greater than 5 percent. Calculations are shown in paragraph (f) of this part IV.</P><P>(2) <I>Flux Uniformity.</I> Uniformity of flux over the specimen must be checked periodically and after each heating element change to determine if it is within acceptable limits of plus or minus 5 percent.</P><P>(3) As noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this part IV, thermopile hot junctions must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to maintain the calibrated sensitivity.</P><P>(d) <I>Preparation of Test Specimens.</I> (1) The test specimens must be representative of the aircraft component in regard to materials and construction methods. The standard size for the test specimens is 5.91 &#xB1;.03 &#xD7; 5.91 &#xB1;.03 inches (149 &#xB1;1 &#xD7; 149 &#xB1;1 mm). The thickness of the specimen must be the same as that of the aircraft component it represents up to a maximum thickness of 1.75 inches (45 mm). Test specimens representing thicker components must be 1.75 inches (45 mm).</P><P>(2) <I>Conditioning.</I> Specimens must be conditioned as described in Part 1 of this appendix.</P><P>(3) <I>Mounting.</I> Each test specimen must be wrapped tightly on all sides of the specimen, except for the one surface that is exposed with a single layer of .001 inch (.025 mm) aluminum foil.</P><P>(e) <I>Procedure.</I> (1) The power supply to the radiant panel must be set to produce a radiant flux of 3.5 &#xB1;.05 W/cm <SU>2</SU>, as measured at the point the center of the specimen surface will occupy when positioned for the test. The radiant flux must be measured after the air flow through the equipment is adjusted to the desired rate.</P><P>(2) After the pilot flames are lighted, their position must be checked as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this part IV.</P><P>(3) Air flow through the apparatus must be controlled by a circular plate orifice located in a 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) I.D. pipe with two pressure measuring points, located 1.5 inches (38 mm) upstream and .75 inches (19 mm) downstream of the orifice plate. The pipe must be connected to a manometer set at a pressure differential of 7.87 inches (200 mm) of Hg. (See Figure 1B of this part IV.) The total air flow to the equipment is approximately .04 m <SU>3</SU>/seconds. The stop on the vertical specimen holder rod must be adjusted so that the exposed surface of the specimen is positioned 3.9 inches (100 mm) from the entrance when injected into the environmental chamber.</P><P>(4) The specimen must be placed in the hold chamber with the radiation doors closed. The airtight outer door must be secured, and the recording devices must be started. The specimen must be retained in the hold chamber for 60 seconds, plus or minus 10 seconds, before injection. The thermopile &#x201C;zero&#x201D; value must be determined during the last 20 seconds of the hold period. The sample must not be injected before completion of the &#x201C;zero&#x201D; value determination.</P><P>(5) When the specimen is to be injected, the radiation doors must be opened. After the specimen is injected into the environmental chamber, the radiation doors must be closed behind the specimen.</P><P>(6) [Reserved]</P><P>(7) Injection of the specimen and closure of the inner door marks time zero. A record of the thermopile output with at least one data point per second must be made during the time the specimen is in the environmental chamber.</P><P>(8) The test duration is five minutes. The lower pilot burner and the upper pilot burner must remain lighted for the entire duration of the test, except that there may be intermittent flame extinguishment for periods that do not exceed 3 seconds. Furthermore, if the optional three-hole upper burner is used, at least two flamelets must remain lighted for the entire duration of the test, except that there may be intermittent flame extinguishment of all three flamelets for periods that do not exceed 3 seconds.</P><P>(9) A minimum of three specimens must be tested.</P><P>(f) <I>Calculations.</I> (1) The calibration factor is calculated as follows:</P><MATH BORDER="NODRAW" DEEP="29" HTYPE="CENTER" POSITION="NOFLOAT" ROTATION="P" SPAN="2" STRIP="YES"><img src="/graphics/ec28se91.072.gif"/></MATH><FP-2>F<E T="52">0</E> = flow of methane at baseline (1pm) </FP-2><FP-2>F<E T="52">1</E> = higher preset flow of methane (1pm) </FP-2><FP-2>V<E T="52">0</E> = thermopile voltage at baseline (mv) </FP-2><FP-2>V<E T="52">1</E> = thermopile voltage at higher flow (mv) </FP-2><FP-2>T<E T="52">a</E> = Ambient temperature (K) </FP-2><FP-2>P = Ambient pressure (mm Hg) </FP-2><FP-2>P<E T="52">v</E> = Water vapor pressure (mm Hg) </FP-2><P>(2) Heat release rates may be calculated from the reading of the thermopile output voltage at any instant of time as:</P><MATH BORDER="NODRAW" DEEP="30" HTYPE="CENTER" POSITION="NOFLOAT" ROTATION="P" SPAN="1" STRIP="YES"><img src="/graphics/er02fe95.006.gif"/></MATH><FP-2>HRR = heat release rate (kw/m <SU>2</SU>) </FP-2><FP-2>V<E T="52">b</E> = baseline voltage (mv) </FP-2><FP-2>V<E T="52">m</E> = measured thermopile voltage (mv) </FP-2><FP-2>K<E T="52">h</E> = calibration factor (kw/mv) </FP-2><P>(3) The integral of the heat release rate is the total heat release as a function of time and is calculated by multiplying the rate by the data sampling frequency in minutes and summing the time from zero to two minutes.</P><P>(g) <I>Criteria.</I> The total positive heat release over the first two minutes of exposure for each of the three or more samples tested must be averaged, and the peak heat release rate for each of the samples must be averaged.

Place the test chamber under an exhaust hood to facilitate clearing the chamber of smoke after each test. The radiant panel test chamber must be an enclosure 55 inches (1397 mm) long by 19.5 (495 mm) deep by 28 (710 mm) to 30 inches (maximum) (762 mm) above the test specimen. Insulate the sides, ends, and top with a fibrous ceramic insulation, such as Kaowool M <SU>TM</SU> board. On the front side, provide a 52 by 12-inch (1321 by 305 mm) draft-free, high-temperature, glass window for viewing the sample during testing. Place a door below the window to provide access to the movable specimen platform holder. The bottom of the test chamber must be a sliding steel platform that has provision for securing the test specimen holder in a fixed and level position. The chamber must have an internal chimney with exterior dimensions of 5.1 inches (129 mm) wide, by 16.2 inches (411 mm) deep by 13 inches (330 mm) high at the opposite end of the chamber from the radiant energy source. The interior dimensions must be 4.5 inches (114 mm) wide by 15.6 inches (395 mm) deep. The chimney must extend to the top of the chamber (see figure 2).</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.004.gif"/><P>(2) <I>Radiant heat source.</I> Mount the radiant heat energy source in a cast iron frame or equivalent. An electric panel must have six, 3-inch wide emitter strips. The emitter strips must be perpendicular to the length of the panel. The panel must have a radiation surface of 12 <FR>7/8</FR> by 18 <FR>1/2</FR> inches (327 by 470 mm). The panel must be capable of operating at temperatures up to 1300 &#xB0;F (704 &#xB0;C). An air propane panel must be made of a porous refractory material and have a radiation surface of 12 by 18 inches (305 by 457 mm). The panel must be capable of operating at temperatures up to 1,500 &#xB0;F (816 &#xB0;C). <I>See</I> figures 3a and 3b.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.005.gif"/><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.006.gif"/><P>(i) <I>Electric radiant panel.</I> The radiant panel must be 3-phase and operate at 208 volts. A single-phase, 240 volt panel is also acceptable. Use a solid-state power controller and microprocessor-based controller to set the electric panel operating parameters.</P><P>(ii) <I>Gas radiant panel.</I> Use propane (liquid petroleum gas&#x2014;2.1 UN 1075) for the radiant panel fuel. The panel fuel system must consist of a venturi-type aspirator for mixing gas and air at approximately atmospheric pressure. Provide suitable instrumentation for monitoring and controlling the flow of fuel and air to the panel. Include an air flow gauge, an air flow regulator, and a gas pressure gauge.</P><P>(iii) <I>Radiant panel placement.</I> Mount the panel in the chamber at 30&#xB0; to the horizontal specimen plane, and 7 <FR>1/2</FR> inches above the zero point of the specimen.</P><P>(3) <I>Specimen holding system.</I> (i) The sliding platform serves as the housing for test specimen placement. Brackets may be attached (via wing nuts) to the top lip of the platform in order to accommodate various thicknesses of test specimens. Place the test specimens on a sheet of Kaowool M <SU>TM</SU> board or 1260 Standard Board (manufactured by Thermal Ceramics and available in Europe), or equivalent, either resting on the bottom lip of the sliding platform or on the base of the brackets. It may be necessary to use multiple sheets of material based on the thickness of the test specimen (to meet the sample height requirement). Typically, these non-combustible sheets of material are available in <FR>1/4</FR> inch (6 mm) thicknesses. See figure 4. A sliding platform that is deeper than the 2-inch (50.8mm) platform shown in figure 4 is also acceptable as long as the sample height requirement is met.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.007.gif"/><P>(ii) Attach a <FR>1/2</FR> inch (13 mm) piece of Kaowool M <SU>TM</SU> board or other high temperature material measuring 41 <FR>1/2</FR> by 8 <FR>1/4</FR> inches (1054 by 210 mm) to the back of the platform. This board serves as a heat retainer and protects the test specimen from excessive preheating. The height of this board must not impede the sliding platform movement (in and out of the test chamber). If the platform has been fabricated such that the back side of the platform is high enough to prevent excess preheating of the specimen when the sliding platform is out, a retainer board is not necessary.</P><P>(iii) Place the test specimen horizontally on the non-combustible board(s). Place a steel retaining/securing frame fabricated of mild steel, having a thickness of <FR>1/8</FR> inch (3.2 mm) and overall dimensions of 23 by 13 <FR>1/8</FR> inches (584 by 333 mm) with a specimen opening of 19 by 10 <FR>3/4</FR> inches (483 by 273 mm) over the test specimen. The front, back, and right portions of the top flange of the frame must rest on the top of the sliding platform, and the bottom flanges must pinch all 4 sides of the test specimen. The right bottom flange must be flush with the sliding platform. See figure 5.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.008.gif"/><P>(4) <I>Pilot Burner.</I> The pilot burner used to ignite the specimen must be a Bernzomatic <SU>TM</SU> commercial propane venturi torch with an axially symmetric burner tip and a propane supply tube with an orifice diameter of 0.006 inches (0.15 mm). The length of the burner tube must be 2 <FR>7/8</FR> inches (71 mm). The propane flow must be adjusted via gas pressure through an in-line regulator to produce a blue inner cone length of <FR>3/4</FR> inch (19 mm). A <FR>3/4</FR> inch (19 mm) guide (such as a thin strip of metal) may be soldered to the top of the burner to aid in setting the flame height. The overall flame length must be approximately 5 inches long (127 mm). Provide a way to move the burner out of the ignition position so that the flame is horizontal and at least 2 inches (50 mm) above the specimen plane. See figure 6.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.009.gif"/><P>(5) <I>Thermocouples.</I> Install a 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG) Type K (Chromel-Alumel) thermocouple in the test chamber for temperature monitoring. Insert it into the chamber through a small hole drilled through the back of the chamber. Place the thermocouple so that it extends 11 inches (279 mm) out from the back of the chamber wall, 11 <FR>1/2</FR> inches (292 mm) from the right side of the chamber wall, and is 2 inches (51 mm) below the radiant panel. The use of other thermocouples is optional.</P><P>(6) <I>Calorimeter.</I> The calorimeter must be a one-inch cylindrical water-cooled, total heat flux density, foil type Gardon Gage that has a range of 0 to 5 BTU/ft <SU>2</SU>-second (0 to 5.7 Watts/cm <SU>2</SU>).</P><P>(7) <I>Calorimeter calibration specification and procedure.</I></P><P>(i) <I>Calorimeter specification.</I></P><P>(A) Foil diameter must be 0.25 &#xB1;0.005 inches (6.35 &#xB1;0.13 mm).</P><P>(B) Foil thickness must be 0.0005 &#xB1;0.0001 inches (0.013 &#xB1;0.0025 mm).</P><P>(C) Foil material must be thermocouple grade Constantan.</P><P>(D) Temperature measurement must be a Copper Constantan thermocouple.</P><P>(E) The copper center wire diameter must be 0.0005 inches (0.013 mm).</P><P>(F) The entire face of the calorimeter must be lightly coated with &#x201C;Black Velvet&#x201D; paint having an emissivity of 96 or greater.</P><P>(ii) <I>Calorimeter calibration.</I> (A) The calibration method must be by comparison to a like standardized transducer.</P><P>(B) The standardized transducer must meet the specifications given in paragraph VI(b)(6) of this appendix.</P><P>(C) Calibrate the standard transducer against a primary standard traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</P><P>(D) The method of transfer must be a heated graphite plate.</P><P>(E) The graphite plate must be electrically heated, have a clear surface area on each side of the plate of at least 2 by 2 inches (51 by 51 mm), and be <FR>1/8</FR> inch &#xB1; <FR>1/16</FR> inch thick (3.2 &#xB1;1.6 mm).</P><P>(F) Center the 2 transducers on opposite sides of the plates at equal distances from the plate.</P><P>(G) The distance of the calorimeter to the plate must be no less than 0.0625 inches (1.6 mm), nor greater than 0.375 inches (9.5 mm).</P><P>(H) The range used in calibration must be at least 0-3.5 BTUs/ft <SU>2</SU> second (0-3.9 Watts/cm <SU>2</SU>) and no greater than 0-5.7 BTUs/ft <SU>2</SU> second (0-6.4 Watts/cm <SU>2</SU>).</P><P>(I) The recording device used must record the 2 transducers simultaneously or at least within <FR>1/10</FR> of each other.</P><P>(8) <I>Calorimeter fixture.</I> With the sliding platform pulled out of the chamber, install the calorimeter holding frame and place a sheet of non-combustible material in the bottom of the sliding platform adjacent to the holding frame. This will prevent heat losses during calibration. The frame must be 13 <FR>1/8</FR> inches (333 mm) deep (front to back) by 8 inches (203 mm) wide and must rest on the top of the sliding platform. It must be fabricated of <FR>1/8</FR> inch (3.2 mm) flat stock steel and have an opening that accommodates a <FR>1/2</FR> inch (12.7 mm) thick piece of refractory board, which is level with the top of the sliding platform. The board must have three 1-inch (25.4 mm) diameter holes drilled through the board for calorimeter insertion. The distance to the radiant panel surface from the centerline of the first hole (&#x201C;zero&#x201D; position) must be 7 <FR>1/2</FR> &#xB1; <FR>1/8</FR> inches (191 &#xB1;3 mm). The distance between the centerline of the first hole to the centerline of the second hole must be 2 inches (51 mm). It must also be the same distance from the centerline of the second hole to the centerline of the third hole. <I>See</I> figure 7. A calorimeter holding frame that differs in construction is acceptable as long as the height from the centerline of the first hole to the radiant panel and the distance between holes is the same as described in this paragraph.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.010.gif"/><P>(9) <I>Instrumentation.</I> Provide a calibrated recording device with an appropriate range or a computerized data acquisition system to measure and record the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouple. The data acquisition system must be capable of recording the calorimeter output every second during calibration.</P><P>(10) <I>Timing device.</I> Provide a stopwatch or other device, accurate to &#xB1;1 second/hour, to measure the time of application of the pilot burner flame.</P><P>(c) <I>Test specimens.</I> (1) <I>Specimen preparation.</I> Prepare and test a minimum of three test specimens. If an oriented film cover material is used, prepare and test both the warp and fill directions.</P><P>(2) <I>Construction.</I> Test specimens must include all materials used in construction of the insulation (including batting, film, scrim, tape etc.). Cut a piece of core material such as foam or fiberglass, and cut a piece of film cover material (if used) large enough to cover the core material. Heat sealing is the preferred method of preparing fiberglass samples, since they can be made without compressing the fiberglass (&#x201C;box sample&#x201D;). Cover materials that are not heat sealable may be stapled, sewn, or taped as long as the cover material is over-cut enough to be drawn down the sides without compressing the core material. The fastening means should be as continuous as possible along the length of the seams. The specimen thickness must be of the same thickness as installed in the airplane.</P><P>(3) <I>Specimen Dimensions.</I> To facilitate proper placement of specimens in the sliding platform housing, cut non-rigid core materials, such as fiberglass, 12 <FR>1/2</FR> inches (318mm) wide by 23 inches (584mm) long. Cut rigid materials, such as foam, 11 <FR>1/2</FR> &#xB1; <FR>1/4</FR> inches (292 mm &#xB1;6mm) wide by 23 inches (584mm) long in order to fit properly in the sliding platform housing and provide a flat, exposed surface equal to the opening in the housing.</P><P>(d) <I>Specimen conditioning.</I> Condition the test specimens at 70 &#xB1;5 &#xB0;F (21 &#xB1;2 &#xB0;C) and 55% &#xB1;10% relative humidity, for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing.</P><P>(e) <I>Apparatus Calibration.</I> (1) With the sliding platform out of the chamber, install the calorimeter holding frame. Push the platform back into the chamber and insert the calorimeter into the first hole (&#x201C;zero&#x201D; position). <I>See</I> figure 7. Close the bottom door located below the sliding platform. The distance from the centerline of the calorimeter to the radiant panel surface at this point must be 7. <FR>1/2</FR> inches &#xB1; <FR>1/8</FR> (191 mm &#xB1;3). Prior to igniting the radiant panel, ensure that the calorimeter face is clean and that there is water running through the calorimeter.</P><P>(2) Ignite the panel. Adjust the fuel/air mixture to achieve 1.5 BTUs/ft <SU>2</SU>-second &#xB1;5% (1.7 Watts/cm <SU>2</SU> &#xB1;5%) at the &#x201C;zero&#x201D; position. If using an electric panel, set the power controller to achieve the proper heat flux. Allow the unit to reach steady state (this may take up to 1 hour). The pilot burner must be off and in the down position during this time.</P><P>(3) After steady-state conditions have been reached, move the calorimeter 2 inches (51 mm) from the &#x201C;zero&#x201D; position (first hole) to position 1 and record the heat flux. Move the calorimeter to position 2 and record the heat flux. Allow enough time at each position for the calorimeter to stabilize. Table 1 depicts typical calibration values at the three positions.</P><DIV width="100%"><DIV class="table_head"><P class="gpotbl_title">Table 1&#x2014;Calibration Table</P></DIV><DIV class="gpotbl_div"><TABLE border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="gpotbl_table" frame="void" width="100%"><TR><TH class="gpotbl_colhed" scope="col">Position </TH><TH class="gpotbl_colhed" scope="col">BTU's/ft <sup>2</sup>sec </TH><TH class="gpotbl_colhed" scope="col">Watts/cm <sup>2</sup></TH></TR><TR><TD align="left" class="gpotbl_cell" scope="row">&#x201C;Zero&#x201D; Position</TD><TD align="right" class="gpotbl_cell">1.5</TD><TD align="right" class="gpotbl_cell">1.7 </TD></TR><TR><TD align="left" class="gpotbl_cell" scope="row">Position 1</TD><TD align="right" class="gpotbl_cell">1.51-1.50-1.49</TD><TD align="right" class="gpotbl_cell">1.71-1.70-1.69 </TD></TR><TR><TD align="left" class="gpotbl_cell" scope="row">Position 2</TD><TD align="right" class="gpotbl_cell">1.43-1.44</TD><TD align="right" class="gpotbl_cell">1.62-1.63</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></DIV><P>(4) Open the bottom door, remove the calorimeter and holder fixture. Use caution as the fixture is very hot.</P><P>(f) <I>Test Procedure.</I> (1) Ignite the pilot burner. Ensure that it is at least 2 inches (51 mm) above the top of the platform. The burner must not contact the specimen until the test begins.</P><P>(2) Place the test specimen in the sliding platform holder. Ensure that the test sample surface is level with the top of the platform. At &#x201C;zero&#x201D; point, the specimen surface must be 7 <FR>1/2</FR> inches &#xB1; <FR>1/8</FR> inch (191 mm &#xB1;3) below the radiant panel.</P><P>(3) Place the retaining/securing frame over the test specimen. It may be necessary (due to compression) to adjust the sample (up or down) in order to maintain the distance from the sample to the radiant panel (7 <FR>1/2</FR> inches &#xB1; <FR>1/8</FR> inch (191 mm&#xB1;3) at &#x201C;zero&#x201D; position). With film/fiberglass assemblies, it is critical to make a slit in the film cover to purge any air inside. This allows the operator to maintain the proper test specimen position (level with the top of the platform) and to allow ventilation of gases during testing. A longitudinal slit, approximately 2 inches (51mm) in length, must be centered 3 inches &#xB1; <FR>1/2</FR> inch (76mm&#xB1;13mm) from the left flange of the securing frame. A utility knife is acceptable for slitting the film cover.</P><P>(4) Immediately push the sliding platform into the chamber and close the bottom door.</P><P>(5) Bring the pilot burner flame into contact with the center of the specimen at the &#x201C;zero&#x201D; point and simultaneously start the timer. The pilot burner must be at a 27&#xB0; angle with the sample and be approximately <FR>1/2</FR> inch (12 mm) above the sample. <I>See</I> figure 7. A stop, as shown in figure 8, allows the operator to position the burner correctly each time.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.011.gif"/><P>(6) Leave the burner in position for 15 seconds and then remove to a position at least 2 inches (51 mm) above the specimen.</P><P>(g) Report.

If this distance is less than 2 inches, report this as a pass (no measurement required).</P><P>(4) Report the after-flame time.</P><P>(h) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) There must be no flame propagation beyond 2 inches (51 mm) to the left of the centerline of the pilot flame application.</P><P>(2) The flame time after removal of the pilot burner may not exceed 3 seconds on any specimen.</P><HD2>Part VII&#x2014;Test Method To Determine the Burnthrough Resistance of Thermal/Acoustic Insulation Materials </HD2><P>Use the following test method to evaluate the burnthrough resistance characteristics of aircraft thermal/acoustic insulation materials when exposed to a high intensity open flame.</P><P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I></P><P><I>Burnthrough time</I> means the time, in seconds, for the burner flame to penetrate the test specimen, and/or the time required for the heat flux to reach 2.0 Btu/ft <SU>2</SU>sec (2.27 W/cm <SU>2</SU>) on the inboard side, at a distance of 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the front surface of the insulation blanket test frame, whichever is sooner. The burnthrough time is measured at the inboard side of each of the insulation blanket specimens.</P><P><I>Insulation blanket specimen</I> means one of two specimens positioned in either side of the test rig, at an angle of 30&#xB0; with respect to vertical.</P><P><I>Specimen set</I> means two insulation blanket specimens. Both specimens must represent the same production insulation blanket construction and materials, proportioned to correspond to the specimen size.</P><P>(b) <I>Apparatus.</I> (1) The arrangement of the test apparatus is shown in figures 1 and 2 and must include the capability of swinging the burner away from the test specimen during warm-up.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.012.gif"/><P>(2) <I>Test burner.</I> The test burner must be a modified gun-type such as the Park Model DPL 3400. Flame characteristics are highly dependent on actual burner setup. Parameters such as fuel pressure, nozzle depth, stator position, and intake airflow must be properly adjusted to achieve the correct flame output.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.013.gif"/><P>(i) <I>Nozzle.</I> A nozzle must maintain the fuel pressure to yield a nominal 6.0 gal/hr (0.378 L/min) fuel flow. A Monarch-manufactured 80&#xB0; PL (hollow cone) nozzle nominally rated at 6.0 gal/hr at 100 lb/in <SU>2</SU> (0.71 MPa) delivers a proper spray pattern.</P><P>(ii) <I>Fuel Rail.</I> The fuel rail must be adjusted to position the fuel nozzle at a depth of 0.3125 inch (8 mm) from the end plane of the exit stator, which must be mounted in the end of the draft tube.</P><P>(iii) <I>Internal Stator.</I> The internal stator, located in the middle of the draft tube, must be positioned at a depth of 3.75 inches (95 mm) from the tip of the fuel nozzle. The stator must also be positioned such that the integral igniters are located at an angle midway between the 10 and 11 o'clock position, when viewed looking into the draft tube. Minor deviations to the igniter angle are acceptable if the temperature and heat flux requirements conform to the requirements of paragraph VII(e) of this appendix.</P><P>(iv) <I>Blower Fan.</I> The cylindrical blower fan used to pump air through the burner must measure 5.25 inches (133 mm) in diameter by 3.5 inches (89 mm) in width.</P><P>(v) <I>Burner cone.</I> Install a 12 + 0.125-inch (305 &#xB1;3 mm) burner extension cone at the end of the draft tube. The cone must have an opening 6 &#xB1;0.125-inch (152 &#xB1;3 mm) high and 11 &#xB1;0.125-inch (280 &#xB1;3 mm) wide (see figure 3).</P><P>(vi) <I>Fuel.</I> Use JP-8, Jet A, or their international equivalent, at a flow rate of 6.0 &#xB1;0.2 gal/hr (0.378 &#xB1;0.0126 L/min). If this fuel is unavailable, ASTM K2 fuel (Number 2 grade kerosene) or ASTM D2 fuel (Number 2 grade fuel oil or Number 2 diesel fuel) are acceptable if the nominal fuel flow rate, temperature, and heat flux measurements conform to the requirements of paragraph VII(e) of this appendix.</P><P>(vii) <I>Fuel pressure regulator.</I> Provide a fuel pressure regulator, adjusted to deliver a nominal 6.0 gal/hr (0.378 L/min) flow rate. An operating fuel pressure of 100 lb/in <SU>2</SU> (0.71 MPa) for a nominally rated 6.0 gal/hr 80&#xB0; spray angle nozzle (such as a PL type) delivers 6.0 &#xB1;0.2 gal/hr (0.378 &#xB1;0.0126 L/min).</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.014.gif"/><P>(3) <I>Calibration rig and equipment.</I> (i) Construct individual calibration rigs to incorporate a calorimeter and thermocouple rake for the measurement of heat flux and temperature. Position the calibration rigs to allow movement of the burner from the test rig position to either the heat flux or temperature position with minimal difficulty.</P><P>(ii) <I>Calorimeter.</I> The calorimeter must be a total heat flux, foil type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range such as 0-20 Btu/ft <SU>2</SU>-sec (0-22.7 W/cm <SU>2</SU>), accurate to &#xB1;3% of the indicated reading. The heat flux calibration method must be in accordance with paragraph VI(b)(7) of this appendix.</P><P>(iii) <I>Calorimeter mounting.</I> Mount the calorimeter in a 6- by 12- &#xB1;0.125 inch (152- by 305- &#xB1;3 mm) by 0.75 &#xB1;0.125 inch (19 mm &#xB1;3 mm) thick insulating block which is attached to the heat flux calibration rig during calibration (figure 4). Monitor the insulating block for deterioration and replace it when necessary. Adjust the mounting as necessary to ensure that the calorimeter face is parallel to the exit plane of the test burner cone.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.015.gif"/><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.016.gif"/><P>(iv) <I>Thermocouples.</I> Provide seven <FR>1/8</FR>-inch (3.2 mm) ceramic packed, metal sheathed, type K (Chromel-alumel), grounded junction thermocouples with a nominal 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG) size conductor for calibration. Attach the thermocouples to a steel angle bracket to form a thermocouple rake for placement in the calibration rig during burner calibration (figure 5).</P><P>(v) <I>Air velocity meter.</I> Use a vane-type air velocity meter to calibrate the velocity of air entering the burner. An Omega Engineering Model HH30A is satisfactory. Use a suitable adapter to attach the measuring device to the inlet side of the burner to prevent air from entering the burner other than through the measuring device, which would produce erroneously low readings. Use a flexible duct, measuring 4 inches wide (102 mm) by 20 feet long (6.1 meters), to supply fresh air to the burner intake to prevent damage to the air velocity meter from ingested soot. An optional airbox permanently mounted to the burner intake area can effectively house the air velocity meter and provide a mounting port for the flexible intake duct.</P><P>(4) <I>Test specimen mounting frame.</I> Make the mounting frame for the test specimens of <FR>1/8</FR>-inch (3.2 mm) thick steel as shown in figure 1, except for the center vertical former, which should be <FR>1/4</FR>-inch (6.4 mm) thick to minimize warpage. The specimen mounting frame stringers (horizontal) should be bolted to the test frame formers (vertical) such that the expansion of the stringers will not cause the entire structure to warp. Use the mounting frame for mounting the two insulation blanket test specimens as shown in figure 2.</P><P>(5) <I>Backface calorimeters.</I> Mount two total heat flux Gardon type calorimeters behind the insulation test specimens on the back side (cold) area of the test specimen mounting frame as shown in figure 6. Position the calorimeters along the same plane as the burner cone centerline, at a distance of 4 inches (102 mm) from the vertical centerline of the test frame.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.017.gif"/><P>(i) The calorimeters must be a total heat flux, foil type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range such as 0-5 Btu/ft <SU>2</SU>-sec (0-5.7 W/cm <SU>2</SU>), accurate to &#xB1;3% of the indicated reading. The heat flux calibration method must comply with paragraph VI(b)(7) of this appendix.</P><P>(6) <I>Instrumentation.</I> Provide a recording potentiometer or other suitable calibrated instrument with an appropriate range to measure and record the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouples.</P><P>(7) <I>Timing device.</I> Provide a stopwatch or other device, accurate to &#xB1;1%, to measure the time of application of the burner flame and burnthrough time.</P><P>(8) <I>Test chamber.</I> Perform tests in a suitable chamber to reduce or eliminate the possibility of test fluctuation due to air movement. The chamber must have a minimum floor area of 10 by 10 feet (305 by 305 cm).</P><P>(i) <I>Ventilation hood.</I> Provide the test chamber with an exhaust system capable of removing the products of combustion expelled during tests.</P><P>(c) <I>Test Specimens.</I> (1) <I>Specimen preparation.</I> Prepare a minimum of three specimen sets of the same construction and configuration for testing.</P><P>(2) <I>Insulation blanket test specimen.</I></P><P>(i) For batt-type materials such as fiberglass, the constructed, finished blanket specimen assemblies must be 32 inches wide by 36 inches long (81.3 by 91.4 cm), exclusive of heat sealed film edges.</P><P>(ii) For rigid and other non-conforming types of insulation materials, the finished test specimens must fit into the test rig in such a manner as to replicate the actual in-service installation.</P><P>(3) <I>Construction.</I> Make each of the specimens tested using the principal components (<I>i.e.,</I> insulation, fire barrier material if used, and moisture barrier film) and assembly processes (representative seams and closures).</P><P>(i) <I>Fire barrier material.</I> If the insulation blanket is constructed with a fire barrier material, place the fire barrier material in a manner reflective of the installed arrangement For example, if the material will be placed on the outboard side of the insulation material, inside the moisture film, place it the same way in the test specimen.</P><P>(ii) <I>Insulation material.</I> Blankets that utilize more than one variety of insulation (composition, density, etc.) must have specimen sets constructed that reflect the insulation combination used. If, however, several blanket types use similar insulation combinations, it is not necessary to test each combination if it is possible to bracket the various combinations.</P><P>(iii) <I>Moisture barrier film.</I> If a production blanket construction utilizes more than one type of moisture barrier film, perform separate tests on each combination. For example, if a polyimide film is used in conjunction with an insulation in order to enhance the burnthrough capabilities, also test the same insulation when used with a polyvinyl fluoride film.</P><P>(iv) <I>Installation on test frame.</I> Attach the blanket test specimens to the test frame using 12 steel spring type clamps as shown in figure 7. Use the clamps to hold the blankets in place in both of the outer vertical formers, as well as the center vertical former (4 clamps per former). The clamp surfaces should measure 1 inch by 2 inches (25 by 51 mm). Place the top and bottom clamps 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the top and bottom of the test frame, respectively. Place the middle clamps 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the top and bottom clamps.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.018.gif"/><P>(Note: For blanket materials that cannot be installed in accordance with figure 7 above, the blankets must be installed in a manner approved by the FAA.)</P><P>(v) <I>Conditioning.</I> Condition the specimens at 70&#xB0; &#xB1;5 &#xB0;F (21&#xB0; &#xB1;2 &#xB0;C) and 55% &#xB1;10% relative humidity for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing.</P><P>(d) <I>Preparation of apparatus.</I> (1) Level and center the frame assembly to ensure alignment of the calorimeter and/or thermocouple rake with the burner cone.</P><P>(2) Turn on the ventilation hood for the test chamber. Do not turn on the burner blower. Measure the airflow of the test chamber using a vane anemometer or equivalent measuring device. The vertical air velocity just behind the top of the upper insulation blanket test specimen must be 100 &#xB1;50 ft/min (0.51 &#xB1;0.25 m/s). The horizontal air velocity at this point must be less than 50 ft/min (0.25 m/s).</P><P>(3) If a calibrated flow meter is not available, measure the fuel flow rate using a graduated cylinder of appropriate size. Turn on the burner motor/fuel pump, after insuring that the igniter system is turned off. Collect the fuel via a plastic or rubber tube into the graduated cylinder for a 2-minute period. Determine the flow rate in gallons per hour. The fuel flow rate must be 6.0 &#xB1;0.2 gallons per hour (0.378 &#xB1;0.0126 L/min).</P><P>(e) <I>Calibration.</I> (1) Position the burner in front of the calorimeter so that it is centered and the vertical plane of the burner cone exit is 4 &#xB1;0.125 inches (102 &#xB1;3 mm) from the calorimeter face. Ensure that the horizontal centerline of the burner cone is offset 1 inch below the horizontal centerline of the calorimeter (figure 8). Without disturbing the calorimeter position, rotate the burner in front of the thermocouple rake, such that the middle thermocouple (number 4 of 7) is centered on the burner cone.</P><img src="/graphics/er31jy03.019.gif"/><P>Ensure that the horizontal centerline of the burner cone is also offset 1 inch below the horizontal centerline of the thermocouple tips. Re-check measurements by rotating the burner to each position to ensure proper alignment between the cone and the calorimeter and thermocouple rake. (Note: The test burner mounting system must incorporate &#x201C;detents&#x201D; that ensure proper centering of the burner cone with respect to both the calorimeter and the thermocouple rakes, so that rapid positioning of the burner can be achieved during the calibration procedure.)</P><P>(2) Position the air velocity meter in the adapter or airbox, making certain that no gaps exist where air could leak around the air velocity measuring device. Turn on the blower/motor while ensuring that the fuel solenoid and igniters are off. Adjust the air intake velocity to a level of 2150 ft/min, (10.92 m/s) then turn off the blower/motor. (Note: The Omega HH30 air velocity meter measures 2.625 inches in diameter. To calculate the intake airflow, multiply the cross-sectional area (0.03758 ft <SU>2</SU>) by the air velocity (2150 ft/min) to obtain 80.80 ft <SU>3</SU>/min. An air velocity meter other than the HH30 unit can be used, provided the calculated airflow of 80.80 ft <SU>3</SU>/min (2.29 m <SU>3</SU>/min) is equivalent.)</P><P>(3) Rotate the burner from the test position to the warm-up position. Prior to lighting the burner, ensure that the calorimeter face is clean of soot deposits, and there is water running through the calorimeter. Examine and clean the burner cone of any evidence of buildup of products of combustion, soot, etc. Soot buildup inside the burner cone may affect the flame characteristics and cause calibration difficulties. Since the burner cone may distort with time, dimensions should be checked periodically.</P><P>(4) While the burner is still rotated to the warm-up position, turn on the blower/motor, igniters and fuel flow, and light the burner. Allow it to warm up for a period of 2 minutes. Move the burner into the calibration position and allow 1 minute for calorimeter stabilization, then record the heat flux once every second for a period of 30 seconds. Turn off burner, rotate out of position, and allow to cool. Calculate the average heat flux over this 30-second duration. The average heat flux should be 16.0 &#xB1;0.8 Btu/ft <SU>2</SU> sec (18.2 &#xB1;0.9 W/cm <SU>2</SU>).</P><P>(5) Position the burner in front of the thermocouple rake. After checking for proper alignment, rotate the burner to the warm-up position, turn on the blower/motor, igniters and fuel flow, and light the burner. Allow it to warm up for a period of 2 minutes. Move the burner into the calibration position and allow 1 minute for thermocouple stabilization, then record the temperature of each of the 7 thermocouples once every second for a period of 30 seconds. Turn off burner, rotate out of position, and allow to cool. Calculate the average temperature of each thermocouple over this 30-second period and record. The average temperature of each of the 7 thermocouples should be 1900 &#xB0;F &#xB1;100 &#xB0;F (1038 &#xB1;56 &#xB0;C).</P><P>(6) If either the heat flux or the temperatures are not within the specified range, adjust the burner intake air velocity and repeat the procedures of paragraphs (4) and (5) above to obtain the proper values. Ensure that the inlet air velocity is within the range of 2150 ft/min &#xB1;50 ft/min (10.92 &#xB1;0.25 m/s).</P><P>(7) Calibrate prior to each test until consistency has been demonstrated. After consistency has been confirmed, several tests may be conducted with calibration conducted before and after a series of tests.</P><P>(f) <I>Test procedure.</I> (1) Secure the two insulation blanket test specimens to the test frame. The insulation blankets should be attached to the test rig center vertical former using four spring clamps positioned as shown in figure 7 (according to the criteria of paragraph paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this part of this appendix).</P><P>(2) Ensure that the vertical plane of the burner cone is at a distance of 4 &#xB1;0.125 inch (102 &#xB1;3 mm) from the outer surface of the horizontal stringers of the test specimen frame, and that the burner and test frame are both situated at a 30&#xB0; angle with respect to vertical.</P><P>(3) When ready to begin the test, direct the burner away from the test position to the warm-up position so that the flame will not impinge on the specimens prematurely. Turn on and light the burner and allow it to stabilize for 2 minutes.</P><P>(4) To begin the test, rotate the burner into the test position and simultaneously start the timing device.</P><P>(5) Expose the test specimens to the burner flame for 4 minutes and then turn off the burner. Immediately rotate the burner out of the test position.</P><P>(6) Determine (where applicable) the burnthrough time, or the point at which the heat flux exceeds 2.0 Btu/ft <SU>2</SU>-sec (2.27 W/cm <SU>2</SU>).</P><P>(g) <I>Report.</I> (1) Identify and describe the specimen being tested.</P><P>(2) Report the number of insulation blanket specimens tested.</P><P>(3) Report the burnthrough time (if any), and the maximum heat flux on the back face of the insulation blanket test specimen, and the time at which the maximum occurred.</P><P>(h) <I>Requirements.</I> (1) Each of the two insulation blanket test specimens must not allow fire or flame penetration in less than 4 minutes.</P><P>(2) Each of the two insulation blanket test specimens must not allow more than 2.0 Btu/ft <SU>2</SU>-sec (2.27 W/cm <SU>2</SU>) on the cold side of the insulation specimens at a point 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the face of the test rig.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[Amdt. 25-32, 37 FR 3972, Feb. 24, 1972] </CITA><EDNOTE><HED>Editorial Note:</HED><PSPACE>For <E T="04">Federal Register</E> citations affecting appendix F to Part 25, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at <I>www.govinfo.gov.</I></PSPACE></EDNOTE></DIV9>

<DIV9 N="Appendix N to Part 25" TYPE="APPENDIX" hierarchy_metadata="{&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/on/_SUBSTITUTE_DATE_/title-14/part-25/appendix-Appendix N to Part 25&quot;,&quot;citation&quot;:&quot;Appendix N to Part 25, Title 14&quot;,&quot;alternate_reference&quot;:&quot;Appendix N to Part 25, FAR&quot;}"><HEAD>Appendix N to Part 25&#x2014;Fuel Tank Flammability Exposure and Reliability Analysis </HEAD><P>N25.1 <I>General.</I></P><P>(a) This appendix specifies the requirements for conducting fuel tank fleet average flammability exposure analyses required to meet &#xA7; 25.981(b) and Appendix M of this part. For fuel tanks installed in aluminum wings, a qualitative assessment is sufficient if it substantiates that the tank is a conventional unheated wing tank.</P><P>(b) This appendix defines parameters affecting fuel tank flammability that must be used in performing the analysis. These include parameters that affect all airplanes within the fleet, such as a statistical distribution of ambient temperature, fuel flash point, flight lengths, and airplane descent rate. Demonstration of compliance also requires application of factors specific to the airplane model being evaluated. Factors that need to be included are maximum range, cruise mach number, typical altitude where the airplane begins initial cruise phase of flight, fuel temperature during both ground and flight times, and the performance of a flammability reduction means (FRM) if installed.</P><P>(c) The following definitions, input variables, and data tables must be used in the program to determine fleet average flammability exposure for a specific airplane model.</P><P>N25.2 <I>Definitions.</I></P><P>(a) <I>Bulk Average Fuel Temperature</I> means the average fuel temperature within the fuel tank or different sections of the tank if the tank is subdivided by baffles or compartments.</P><P>(b) <I>Flammability Exposure Evaluation Time (FEET).</I> The time from the start of preparing the airplane for flight, through the flight and landing, until all payload is unloaded, and all passengers and crew have disembarked. In the Monte Carlo program, the flight time is randomly selected from the Flight Length Distribution (Table 2), the pre-flight times are provided as a function of the flight time, and the post-flight time is a constant 30 minutes.</P><P>(c) <I>Flammable.</I> With respect to a fluid or gas, flammable means susceptible to igniting readily or to exploding (14 CFR Part 1, Definitions). A non-flammable ullage is one where the fuel-air vapor is too lean or too rich to burn or is inert as defined below. For the purposes of this appendix, a fuel tank that is not inert is considered flammable when the bulk average fuel temperature within the tank is within the flammable range for the fuel type being used. For any fuel tank that is subdivided into sections by baffles or compartments, the tank is considered flammable when the bulk average fuel temperature within any section of the tank, that is not inert, is within the flammable range for the fuel type being used.</P><P>(d) <I>Flash Point.</I> The flash point of a flammable fluid means the lowest temperature at which the application of a flame to a heated sample causes the vapor to ignite momentarily, or &#x201C;flash.&#x201D; Table 1 of this appendix provides the flash point for the standard fuel to be used in the analysis.</P><P>(e) <I>Fleet average flammability exposure</I> is the percentage of the flammability exposure evaluation time (FEET) each fuel tank ullage is flammable for a fleet of an airplane type operating over the range of flight lengths in a world-wide range of environmental conditions and fuel properties as defined in this appendix.</P><P>(f) <I>Gaussian Distribution</I> is another name for the normal distribution, a symmetrical frequency distribution having a precise mathematical formula relating the mean and standard deviation of the samples. Gaussian distributions yield bell-shaped frequency curves having a preponderance of values around the mean with progressively fewer observations as the curve extends outward.</P><P>(g) <I>Hazardous atmosphere.</I> An atmosphere that may expose maintenance personnel, passengers or flight crew to the risk of death, incapacitation, impairment of ability to self-rescue (that is, escape unaided from a confined space), injury, or acute illness.</P><P>(h) <I>Inert.</I> For the purpose of this appendix, the tank is considered inert when the bulk average oxygen concentration within each compartment of the tank is 12 percent or less from sea level up to 10,000 feet altitude, then linearly increasing from 12 percent at 10,000 feet to 14.5 percent at 40,000 feet altitude, and extrapolated linearly above that altitude.</P><P>(i) <I>Inerting.</I> A process where a noncombustible gas is introduced into the ullage of a fuel tank so that the ullage becomes non-flammable.</P><P>(j) <I>Monte Carlo Analysis.</I> The analytical method that is specified in this appendix as the compliance means for assessing the fleet average flammability exposure time for a fuel tank.</P><P>(k) <I>Oxygen evolution</I> occurs when oxygen dissolved in the fuel is released into the ullage as the pressure and temperature in the fuel tank are reduced.</P><P>(l) <I>Standard deviation</I> is a statistical measure of the dispersion or variation in a distribution, equal to the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic means.</P><P>(m) <I>Transport Effects.</I> For purposes of this appendix, transport effects are the change in fuel vapor concentration in a fuel tank caused by low fuel conditions and fuel condensation and vaporization.</P><P>(n) <I>Ullage.</I> The volume within the fuel tank not occupied by liquid fuel.</P><P>N25.3 <I>Fuel tank flammability exposure analysis.</I></P><P>(a) A flammability exposure analysis must be conducted for the fuel tank under evaluation to determine fleet average flammability exposure for the airplane and fuel types under evaluation. For fuel tanks that are subdivided by baffles or compartments, an analysis must be performed either for each section of the tank, or for the section of the tank having the highest flammability exposure. Consideration of transport effects is not allowed in the analysis. The analysis must be done in accordance with the methods and procedures set forth in the Fuel Tank Flammability Assessment Method User's Manual, dated May 2008, document number DOT/FAA/AR-05/8 (incorporated by reference, see &#xA7; 25.5). The parameters specified in sections N25.3(b) and (c) of this appendix must be used in the fuel tank flammability exposure &#x201C;Monte Carlo&#x201D; analysis.</P><P>(b) The following parameters are defined in the Monte Carlo analysis and provided in paragraph N25.4 of this appendix:</P><P>(1) Cruise Ambient Temperature, as defined in this appendix.</P><P>(2) Ground Ambient Temperature, as defined in this appendix.</P><P>(3) Fuel Flash Point, as defined in this appendix.</P><P>(4) Flight Length Distribution, as defined in Table 2 of this appendix.</P><P>(5) Airplane Climb and Descent Profiles, as defined in the Fuel Tank Flammability Assessment Method User's Manual, dated May 2008, document number DOT/FAA/AR-05/8 (incorporated by reference in &#xA7; 25.5).</P><P>(c) Parameters that are specific to the particular airplane model under evaluation that must be provided as inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis are:</P><P>(1) Airplane cruise altitude.</P><P>(2) Fuel tank quantities. If fuel quantity affects fuel tank flammability, inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis must be provided that represent the actual fuel quantity within the fuel tank or compartment of the fuel tank throughout each of the flights being evaluated. Input values for this data must be obtained from ground and flight test data or the approved FAA fuel management procedures.</P><P>(3) Airplane cruise mach number.</P><P>(4) Airplane maximum range.</P><P>(5) Fuel tank thermal characteristics. If fuel temperature affects fuel tank flammability, inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis must be provided that represent the actual bulk average fuel temperature within the fuel tank at each point in time throughout each of the flights being evaluated. For fuel tanks that are subdivided by baffles or compartments, bulk average fuel temperature inputs must be provided for each section of the tank. Input values for these data must be obtained from ground and flight test data or a thermal model of the tank that has been validated by ground and flight test data.</P><P>(6) Maximum airplane operating temperature limit, as defined by any limitations in the airplane flight manual.</P><P>(7) Airplane Utilization. The applicant must provide data supporting the number of flights per day and the number of hours per flight for the specific airplane model under evaluation. If there is no existing airplane fleet data to support the airplane being evaluated, the applicant must provide substantiation that the number of flights per day and the number of hours per flight for that airplane model is consistent with the existing fleet data they propose to use.</P><P>(d) <I>Fuel Tank FRM Model.</I> If FRM is used, an FAA approved Monte Carlo program must be used to show compliance with the flammability requirements of &#xA7; 25.981 and Appendix M of this part. The program must determine the time periods during each flight phase when the fuel tank or compartment with the FRM would be flammable. The following factors must be considered in establishing these time periods:</P><P>(1) Any time periods throughout the flammability exposure evaluation time and under the full range of expected operating conditions, when the FRM is operating properly but fails to maintain a non-flammable fuel tank because of the effects of the fuel tank vent system or other causes,</P><P>(2) If dispatch with the system inoperative under the Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) is requested, the time period assumed in the reliability analysis (60 flight hours must be used for a 10-day MMEL dispatch limit unless an alternative period has been approved by the Administrator),</P><P>(3) Frequency and duration of time periods of FRM inoperability, substantiated by test or analysis acceptable to the FAA, caused by latent or known failures, including airplane system shut-downs and failures that could cause the FRM to shut down or become inoperative.</P><P>(4) Effects of failures of the FRM that could increase the flammability exposure of the fuel tank.</P><P>(5) If an FRM is used that is affected by oxygen concentrations in the fuel tank, the time periods when oxygen evolution from the fuel results in the fuel tank or compartment exceeding the inert level. The applicant must include any times when oxygen evolution from the fuel in the tank or compartment under evaluation would result in a flammable fuel tank. The oxygen evolution rate that must be used is defined in the Fuel Tank Flammability Assessment Method User's Manual, dated May 2008, document number DOT/FAA/AR-05/8 (incorporated by reference in &#xA7; 25.5).</P><P>(6) If an inerting system FRM is used, the effects of any air that may enter the fuel tank following the last flight of the day due to changes in ambient temperature, as defined in Table 4, during a 12-hour overnight period.</P><P>(e) The applicant must submit to the responsible Aircraft Certification Service officefor approval the fuel tank flammability analysis, including the airplane-specific parameters identified under paragraph N25.3(c) of this appendix and any deviations from the parameters identified in paragraph N25.3(b) of this appendix that affect flammability exposure, substantiating data, and any airworthiness limitations and other conditions assumed in the analysis.</P><P>N25.4 <I>Variables and data tables.</I></P><P>The following data must be used when conducting a flammability exposure analysis to determine the fleet average flammability exposure. Variables used to calculate fleet flammability exposure must include atmospheric ambient temperatures, flight length, flammability exposure evaluation time, fuel flash point, thermal characteristics of the fuel tank, overnight temperature drop, and oxygen evolution from the fuel into the ullage.</P><P>(a) Atmospheric Ambient Temperatures and Fuel Properties.</P><P>(1) In order to predict flammability exposure during a given flight, the variation of ground ambient temperatures, cruise ambient temperatures, and a method to compute the transition from ground to cruise and back again must be used. The variation of the ground and cruise ambient temperatures and the flash point of the fuel is defined by a Gaussian curve, given by the 50 percent value and a &#xB1;1-standard deviation value.</P><P>(2) Ambient Temperature: Under the program, the ground and cruise ambient temperatures are linked by a set of assumptions on the atmosphere. The temperature varies with altitude following the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) rate of change from the ground ambient temperature until the cruise temperature for the flight is reached. Above this altitude, the ambient temperature is fixed at the cruise ambient temperature. This results in a variation in the upper atmospheric temperature. For cold days, an inversion is applied up to 10,000 feet, and then the ISA rate of change is used.</P><P>(3) Fuel properties:</P><P>(i) For Jet A fuel, the variation of flash point of the fuel is defined by a Gaussian curve, given by the 50 percent value and a &#xB1;1-standard deviation, as shown in Table 1 of this appendix.</P><P>(ii) The flammability envelope of the fuel that must be used for the flammability exposure analysis is a function of the flash point of the fuel selected by the Monte Carlo for a given flight. The flammability envelope for the fuel is defined by the upper flammability limit (UFL) and lower flammability limit (LFL) as follows:</P><P>(A) LFL at sea level = flash point temperature of the fuel at sea level minus 10 &#xB0;F. LFL decreases from sea level value with increasing altitude at a rate of 1 &#xB0;F per 808 feet.</P><P>(B) UFL at sea level = flash point temperature of the fuel at sea level plus 63.5 &#xB0;F. UFL decreases from the sea level value with increasing altitude at a rate of 1 &#xB0;F per 512 feet.</P><P>(4) For each flight analyzed, a separate random number must be generated for each of the three parameters (ground ambient temperature, cruise ambient temperature, and fuel flash point) using the Gaussian distribution defined in Table 1 of this appendix.</P><DIV width="100%"><DIV
