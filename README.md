Intention is to create a chatbot that can use an LLM augmented with widely available resources supporting type certification of aircraft.

## Goals:
- Successfully create a streaming chatbot using openai API (GPT4 or local models via lmstudio)
- Create tools for LLM workflows such that it can:
 - Search specific sites like ecfr
 - Use PDFs of available aero guidelines
 - JSON of Part 25 and related regulations
 - CS-25 from EASA
